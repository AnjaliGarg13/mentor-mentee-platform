# Landscape Design - Idea Validation phase I
On behalf of landscape group from Rails Girls CPH meet up,  we came up with an idea of creating a google form to test the number of people who will be interested of being a mentor or mentee. Later, we will collect all the questions from mentors and mentee group and then create a questionaire form. Here are the summary from today's meetup. 

**Are you interested in Mentoring or Finding a mentor?**
1. Mentors
* Skills - which programming language and which field do you work
* How long have you been in programming?
* Frequency - how often can you dedicate your time
* Offline/Online - A communication platform
* Availability
* What do you want to get out of it?
* What do you want to offer?
* Would you like to mentor more than one mentee at once?

2. Mentees
* In which coding language do you need help
* What are your expectation?
* How often do you need help?
* What kind of resources do are you looking for?
* Are you completely new or have some experience in programming?

**We decided to distribute the questionaires through some of the platforms below:**
* Lightning talks in meetups
* Share the questionaires in 
  * Railsgirls Slack
  * Hack Your Future Slack
  * QR Code
  * Stickers

## Mentees Group Notes

We discussed from a mentee's point of view what they would want in order to join the platform.

 ### Why does one want to be a mentee?
Two types of needs:
1. Code Advice
2. Career Advice
The first type is language-speciffic and the second sin't neccesarily.
Suggestion for helping the mentee find the right person: tags for mentors. Tags could include 'code advoce', 'JavaScript', 'career advice', helping the mentee find her match.

 ### Taking care of welcoming total beginners
*	Total beginners might not know what language to specialize in, so a way to welcome them could be to have the option of not having to specify that when you first ask to be a mentee.

### A Mentee can also be a Mentor
* Broad consensus in the group that this should be a feature.

# Idea Phase II

On our second meeting, we continued talking about what the user should be able to do with our app. 

## Users, One or Many Types?

The big discussion of the evening was about how many kinds of users we want to support.

  * One group liked the idea of having one user login with tags defining mentor or mentee role.
  * One group wants to have two kinds of users with separate logins: mentors and mentees.
Solution? Voting in slack!

### Tags

Agreement (no matter how many kionds of users) to implement a system with tags.
Tags could come from a questionaire the user fills out in the beginning.

### Tag Categories

We would like to differetiate between different aims the user may have: wanting to receive or give help. Which kind of help: Soft skills vs technical skills.
It was discussed how the user can both be mentor and mentee, and many in the group prefer that the user has a custommized experince based on which they pick.

### Scope

We again discussed that we don't want to build another tsack overflow: the aim should be to make this a space for more career inspiration.

### MVP

It's complicated having two kinds of users! For the Minimally Viable Product, we might want to go with only one user.

### Search
Agreement that we want a search function where you can look for both skills and people.
