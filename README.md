# Landscape Design - Idea Validation phase
On behalf of landscape group from Rails Girls CPH meet up,  we came up with an idea of creating a google form to test the number of people who will be interested of being a mentor or mentee. Later, we will collect all the questions from mentors and mentee group and then create a questionaire form. Here are the summary from today's meetup. 

**Are you interested in Mentoring or Finding a mentor?**
1. Mentors
* Skills - which programming language and which field do you work
* How long have you been in programming?
* Frequency - how often can you dedicate your time
* Offline/Online - A communication platform
* Availability
* What do you want to get out of it?
* What do you want to offer?
* Would you like to mentor more than one mentee at once?


2. Mentees
* In which coding language do you need help
* What are your expectation?
* How often do you need help?
* What kind of resources do are you looking for?
* Are you completely new or have some experience in programming?

**We decided to distribute the questionaires through some of the platforms below:**
* Lightning talks in meetups
* Share the questionaires in 
  * Railsgirls Slack
  * Hack Your Future Slack
  * QR Code
  * Stickers
