# Landscape Design - Idea Validation phase I
On behalf of landscape group from Rails Girls CPH meet up,  we came up with an idea of creating a google form to test the number of people who will be interested of being a mentor or mentee. Later, we will collect all the questions from mentors and mentee group and then create a questionaire form. Here are the summary from today's meetup. 

**Are you interested in Mentoring or Finding a mentor?**
1. Mentors
* Skills - which programming language and which field do you work
* How long have you been in programming?
* Frequency - how often can you dedicate your time
* Offline/Online - A communication platform
* Availability
* What do you want to get out of it?
* What do you want to offer?
* Would you like to mentor more than one mentee at once?

2. Mentees
* In which coding language do you need help
* What are your expectation?
* How often do you need help?
* What kind of resources do are you looking for?
* Are you completely new or have some experience in programming?

**We decided to distribute the questionnaires through some of the platforms below:**
* Lightning talks in meetups
* Share the questionnaires in
  * Railsgirls Slack
  * Hack Your Future Slack
  * QR Code
  * Stickers

## Mentor Group Notes
We discussed from a mentor's point of view what they would want in order to join the platform.

### Why does one want to be a mentor?
To contribute to the community.
Something a mentor would like to make sure that the mentee is motivated.

### Things Mentors could offer/help with and how they plan to offer their help.
*	Helping with job interviews, salary negotiations, motivation/encouragement.
* Code reviews on Git
*	How do they want to work with coding challenges for example-- reviewing pull requests, and code review
*	Telling how much time they have to offer-- for example as 1 hour / week. And/or for how long of a time period they would like to be a mentor-- for example for the period of 3 months or 6 months...

### Somethings mentors might like on the platform:
*	As a mentor, your might also want to invite other mentors.
*	As a mentor you can search for what a mentee is looking for.
*	As a mentor, can a mentee choose you or make a request to choose you?
* Or does a mentor pick a mentee through the platform.
*	As a mentor, have the ability to set a maximum amount of mentees

### A way to help keep a mentor motivated could be through some type of gamification with badges.

###### We just started to talk about what a Mentor's profile could include
1. Name
2. Company
3. Languages they work with and will help with
4. Available time.


## Mentees Group Notes

We discussed from a mentee's point of view what they would want in order to join the platform.

### Why does one want to be a mentee?
Two types of needs:
1. Code Advice
2. Career Advice
The first type is language-specific and the second sin't necessarily.
Suggestion for helping the mentee find the right person: tags for mentors. Tags could include 'code advice', 'JavaScript', 'career advice', helping the mentee find her match.

### Taking care of welcoming total beginners
*	Total beginners might not know what language to specialize in, so a way to welcome them could be to have the option of not having to specify that when you first ask to be a mentee.

### A Mentee can also be a Mentor
* Broad consensus in the group that this should be a feature.

# Idea Phase II

On our second meeting, we continued talking about what the user should be able to do with our app. 

## Users, One or Many Types?

The big discussion of the evening was about how many kinds of users we want to support.

  * One group liked the idea of having one user login with tags defining mentor or mentee role.
  * One group wants to have two kinds of users with separate logins: mentors and mentees.
Solution? Voting in slack!

### Tags

Agreement (no matter how many kionds of users) to implement a system with tags.
Tags could come from a questionaire the user fills out in the beginning.

### Tag Categories

We would like to differetiate between different aims the user may have: wanting to receive or give help. Which kind of help: Soft skills vs technical skills.
It was discussed how the user can both be mentor and mentee, and many in the group prefer that the user has a custommized experince based on which they pick.

### Scope

We again discussed that we don't want to build another tsack overflow: the aim should be to make this a space for more career inspiration.

### MVP

It's complicated having two kinds of users! For the Minimally Viable Product, we might want to go with only one user.

### Search
Agreement that we want a search function where you can look for both skills and people.
